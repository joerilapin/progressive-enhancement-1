<h2>The story</h2>

<blockquote>
    <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around
        to commiserate. They said, <q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
            unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em></q>. The next day the horse came back
        bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="villagers">Oh,
            isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q
                class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em></q>.</p>

    <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
        The neighbors then said, <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span></q>, and the
        farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em></q>. The next day the conscription officers came around to
        conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors
        came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q
                class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em></q>.</p>

    <p>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell
        whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because
        you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences
        of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span
        class="good">good</span> for
    monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">good</span> for bananas. Let's not
    make a big deal out of it...</p>
